Drawing a pair of tangents to a circle of radius 4cm which is centered at O, from an external point P which touch the circle at Q1 and Q2:\\

    \includegraphics{code}\\   
    \caption{}
Clearly, OQ2P is a right-angled triangle.So, we can use pythogorean theorem to find PQ2, which is the length of tangent required.\\
    
    \includegraphics{length}
    
\begin{center} 
     
    Therefore, the length of the tangent drawn from P to the given circle is 5.744563
